Shared Dependencies:

1. **React**: All frontend components will import React for component creation and lifecycle methods.

2. **Next.js**: All pages will import Next.js for server-side rendering and routing.

3. **Express.js**: The server.js file and all route files will import Express.js for server setup and HTTP request handling.

4. **Mongoose**: All model files will import Mongoose for schema definition and database interaction.
